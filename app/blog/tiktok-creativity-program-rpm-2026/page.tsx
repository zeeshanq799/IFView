          <h2>TikTok Creativity Program RPM Per 1000 Views (Typical &amp; Estimated Rates)</h2>

          <p>
            In 2026, the typical TikTok Creativity Program RPM per 1000 views ranges from <strong>$0.40 to $1.20</strong> depending on audience country, watch time, and content niche.
            Most creators targeting Tier 1 countries report estimated RPM between $0.70 and $1.00.
          </p>

          <p>
            If your content reaches United States or United Kingdom audiences, your estimated RPM per 1000 views can exceed $1.00 during peak advertiser seasons.
            Creators in lower CPM regions may see RPM closer to $0.20–$0.50.
          </p>

          <h2>What Affects TikTok Creativity Program RPM?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Audience country (Tier 1 countries generate higher advertiser demand)</li>
            <li>Watch time and completion rate</li>
            <li>Video length (minimum 1 minute required)</li>
            <li>Ad demand and seasonality</li>
            <li>Content niche (finance, business, and tech perform better)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Real Earnings Example</h2>

          <p>
            If a creator receives 500,000 qualified views in a month at an average RPM of $0.90, their estimated earnings would be:
          </p>

          <p><strong>500,000 &divide; 1,000 &times; $0.90 = $450</strong></p>

          <p>
            Creators targeting Tier 1 countries like the United States or United Kingdom can often achieve RPM above $1.00 during high advertiser seasons.
          </p>

            However, RPM depends heavily on audience geography and engagement quality.
