          <h1 className="article-h1">How Much Does TikTok Pay in 2026? Complete TikTok Earnings Guide</h1>
          <div className="article-meta">Last Updated: February 14, 2026 &middot; 10 min read</div>
        </header>

        <div className="article-body">
          <p>TikTok has evolved into a serious income platform. But unlike YouTube, TikTok monetization works differently &mdash;
            and many creators misunderstand how payments actually work.</p>

          <div className="callout">
            <strong>Quick Overview:</strong><br />
            Creativity Program RPM: $0.50 &ndash; $1.10<br />
            Brand Deals: $100 &ndash; $10,000+ per video<br />
            TikTok Shop: 10&ndash;20% commission per sale
          </div>

          <hr />

          <h2>1. TikTok Creativity Program (Main Ad Revenue)</h2>

          <p>The Creativity Program replaced the old Creator Fund and significantly improved payouts.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Minimum 10,000 followers</li>
            <li>100,000 views in last 30 days</li>
            <li>Videos must be longer than 1 minute</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Average RPM:</strong> $0.50 &ndash; $1.10</p>

          <div className="callout">
            Example: 1,000,000 views &times; $0.80 RPM = $800
          </div>

          <p>Compared to the old Creator Fund ($0.02 CPM), this is a major improvement.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>2. Brand Sponsorship Income</h2>

          <p>For serious creators, brand deals are the primary income source.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>10k&ndash;50k followers:</strong> $100&ndash;$500 per post</li>
            <li><strong>50k&ndash;500k followers:</strong> $1,000&ndash;$5,000</li>
            <li><strong>1M+ followers:</strong> $10,000+</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Engagement rate matters more than follower count.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>3. TikTok Shop Affiliate</h2>

          <p>TikTok Shop allows creators to tag products and earn commission.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Commission rates: 10&ndash;20%</li>
            <li>High conversion potential on viral videos</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Many creators now earn more from affiliate sales than from ad revenue.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>4. TikTok LIVE Gifts</h2>

          <p>Creators can earn through LIVE streaming via virtual gifts.</p>

          <p>Earnings vary based on audience loyalty and frequency of streams.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>How TikTok Compares to YouTube</h2>

          <p>TikTok ad RPM is lower than YouTube RPM. However, TikTok&apos;s viral reach can generate massive exposure quickly.</p>
